 1. Introduction
 The Attendance Management System is a Python-based project that aims to streamline and
 automate the process of managing attendance for various organizations, schools, or institutions.
 This system provides an efficient way to record, monitor, and manage attendance data for
 students, employees, or any group of individuals. It does this by providing a user-friendly
 interface that allows users to easily add, update, and delete attendance records. The system
 also generates reports that can be used to track attendance trends and identify areas where
 improvement is needed.

 2. Project Overview
 The main objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly system that allows administrators,
 teachers, or managers to track attendance and generate reports easily. The system provides a
 simple command-line interface for interacting with the attendance data. This means that users
 can enter commands to view, add, update, or delete attendance records. The system also
 generates reports that can be used to track attendance trends over time. These reports can be
 used to identify students or employees who are frequently absent, which can help
 administrators or managers to take corrective action. The system is designed to be easy to use
 and navigate, even for users who are not familiar with computers. It is also designed to be
 secure, so that only authorized users can access the attendance data.

 3. Project Features
 The following are the features of the attendance management system:
 ● Userlogin and authentication
 ● Adding and managing students/employees' information
 ● Marking attendance on a specific date for individuals or groups
● Viewing attendance records for a particular student/employee
 ● Generating monthly/weekly/daily attendance reports
 ● Exporting attendance data to a CSV file for further analysis

 4. System Requirements
 ● Python 3.x
 ● Command-line interface (CLI) capabilities

 5. Installation
 ● Clonethe project repository from GitHub: [GitHub Repo URL]
 ● Navigate to the project directory.
 ● Install the required libraries using pip: pip install-r requirements.txt

 6. Usage
 To run the Attendance Management System, user can follow these steps:
 ● Openaterminal or command prompt.
 ● Navigate to the project directory.
 ● Runthemain Python script: python main.py
 ● Follow the on-screen instructions for various tasks.

 7. Tasks and Implementation Details

 7.1 Task 1: User Authentication
 Description: Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the
 system.
 Subtasks:
 ○ Create a user database with login credentials.(Note that we are not to use any
 database system at this stage of the project. Only core Python capabilities are to
 be used)
 ○ Implement login and registration functionalities.
 ○ Validate user credentials during login.

 Description: Create a system to manage student/employee information.
 Subtasks:
 1. Create a database implemented using a suitable data structure to store the information.
 2. Write functions to add, view, update, and delete records.
 3. Validate user input to ensure data integrity.
    
 7.3 Task 3: Marking Attendance
 Description: Allow users to mark attendance for individuals or groups on specific dates.
 Subtasks:
 1. Implement a function to display a list of students/employees for marking attendance.
 2. Record attendance data in the database implemented using a suitable data structure
 3. Handle conflicts if attendance is already marked for a specific date.
 
 7.4 Task 4: Viewing Attendance Records
 Description: Enable users to view attendance records for a particular student/employee.
 Subtasks:
 1. Implement a function to search for and display individual attendance records.
 2. Allow users to filter records based on date or other parameters.

 7.5 Task 5: Generating Reports
 Description: Develop functionalities to generate attendance reports.
